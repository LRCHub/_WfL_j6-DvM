[00:03.85] Saging my bedroom
[00:07.88] Dusting every surface, every corner
[00:12.97] Pleading and praying it gets warmer
[00:17.16] In this hollow winter tide
[00:24.17] Three hours of sunlight
[00:27.36] Don't really matter when you're deprived
[00:32.62] Of happiness, and weakened advised
[00:37.11] To find some oxygen
[00:43.95] Sweeter pastures, wait for me like a lover
[00:53.84] My soul has suffered, get the fuck out of my atmosphere
[01:02.18] I'm breathing clean, clean air
[01:08.56] Went through an X-ray
[01:11.99] Doctor said there's nothing left to see now
[01:17.03] Nothing weird or scary, although somehow
[01:21.88] Your heart turned back to gold
[01:28.63] Guess I'd been wounded
[01:31.68] Tiny comments ricocheted like bullets
[01:36.75] Cyclone on a sunny day
[01:39.03] You shook it and dragged me down to hell
[01:47.97] Now sweeter pastures, wait for me like a lover
[01:58.27] Lord knows I've suffered, get the fuck out of my atmosphere
[02:06.55] I'm breathing clean, clean air
[02:10.76] Oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:17.86] Clean air
[02:20.25] Oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:26.96] I'm breathing clean, clean air
