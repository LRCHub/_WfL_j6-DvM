Saging my bedroom
Dusting every surface,
every corner
Pleading and praying it gets warmer
In this hollow winter tide
Three hours of sunlight
Don't really matter
when you're deprived
Of happiness, enweakened, advised
To find some oxygen
Sweeter pastures,
wait for me like a lover
My soul has suffered,
so get out of my pure atmosphere
I'm breathing clean, clean air
Went through an X-ray
Doctor said there's nothing left
to see now
Nothing weird or scary,
although somehow
Your heart turned back to gold
Guess I'd been wounded
Tiny comments ricocheted
like bullets
Cyclone on a sunny day
You shook it and dragged me
down to hell
Now sweeter pastures,
wait for me like a lover
Lord knows I've suffered,
so get out of my pure atmosphere
I'm breathing clean, clean air
Oh-oh-oh
Clean air
Oh-oh-oh
I'm breathing clean, clean air
